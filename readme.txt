== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Do I have to use the LSX theme with this plugin?
Yes, this plugin is designed specifically for LSX theme, and has not been tested with other themes.

= Is this plugin free? =
We believe in open source – that’s why the LSX Blocks plugin is free, and that won’t change. This plugin is actively maintained and updated.

= I’ve installed this plugin, what is the next step? =
Login to your WordPress dashboard, and create a new post or page.  Click the plus sign to add a block, and search for lsx to find the LSX Blocks that you can use now.

= Do I need to use Separator blocks to build my pages with LSX Blocks?
This is not necessary as the Group and Cover blocks have controls for internal padding and margins.

= How can I control the width of a block? =
If a block (like the post grid or carousel) is in a container, it will take the width of the container itself.  If these blocks are outside of a container, they will take the width that is assigned to that block.  Blocks that don't have width options (like the shortcode block) will take the width of the container block.  If these blocks are outside of a container, they will take the width that is assigned to that block.

= Why are my custom font sizes not working as expected for headings and paragraph blocks? =
If you use the group block with a heading and a paragraph inside, and select the block style 'lsx subheading' the font sizes of this style will override the set custom sizes.

= I’m struggling to get the layout I desire, what am I doing wrong? =
Avoid nesting too many groups or cover blocks if possible.
