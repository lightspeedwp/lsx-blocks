The new Gutenberg editor is here, and with it comes the new block-based page builder. 

We have built these content blocks so you can simply drag and drop them into your editor, configure to your wishes and you are done!

## Works with the LSX Theme
Our modern and lightweight [theme](https://lsx.lsdev.biz/) works perfectly with the LSX Blocks, improving internal linking, website SEO and user experience! 

## Getting Started with LSX Blocks 

* Login to the backend of your WordPress website.
* Navigate to the "Plugins" item in your dashboard.
* Select "Add New".
* Search for "LSX Blocks" in the plugin search bar.
* Once you see the LSX Blocks plugin, select "Install".
* Activate the plugin. 
* That's it, you can now make use of the LSX Blocks when building a new post or page! 

### Merge Tags for the Navigation Blocks

* CSS Classname `hide-logged-in` - Will stop the block HTML from rendering while the user is logged in.
* CSS Classname `hide-logged-out` - Will stop the block HTML from rendering while the user is logged out.
* Navigation Link URL `#logoutlink` - Will be replaced with a secure log out link. It will default to a WooCommerce logout link if the plugin is enabled.
